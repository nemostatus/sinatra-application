Short description
So when I first heard we were going to be building a sinatra application I had many project ideas pass through my mind and I found myself writing down the ideas and from there it was difficult to know which one to go with so ironically I thought, why not create a sinatra project that will help students not only create a project idea and name but also rate them based on current knowledge, passion and whether or not they feel comfortable completing the project. So I went with that idea thinking it can not only help me but any other student interested in my application.
